# Qualtrics Processing Pipeline



Hello there! If you've ever spent hours wrestling with a messy survey data export, you're in the right place. This automated Python pipeline was built to take that tedious, error-prone work off your plate so you can get back to what matters: discovering amazing insights from your data.

This script transforms raw, cryptic Qualtrics Excel files into a complete, documented, and analysis-ready package with just a few clicks.

## The Challenge: Why Is Survey Data So Hard to Work With?



Anyone who has worked with survey data knows that the real work begins *after* the data is collected. Raw exports from platforms like Qualtrics are a fantastic starting point, but they come with hidden challenges that can take hours of manual work to overcome:

- **Mixed-in Test Data:** Preview and test responses are often included, which can skew your results if not carefully removed.
- **Inconsistent Data Types:** Numbers and dates are often formatted as text, leading to frustrating errors when you try to perform calculations or create plots.
- **Cryptic Headers:** Column names like `Q5_3_TEXT` are meaningless without a legend, making your analysis slow and difficult to interpret.
- **Lack of Documentation:** The raw file provides no context, making it hard to trust the data or reproduce your cleaning process later.

This manual cleaning is not only time-consuming but also prone to human error, potentially compromising the integrity of your analysis.

## The Solution: Your Automated Data Assistant



This Jupyter Notebook provides a robust, one-click solution to these challenges. It acts as an intelligent pipeline that ingests a raw Qualtrics Excel file and automatically produces a professional-grade analysis package.

The pipeline handles all the tedious "data janitor" work, allowing you to move directly from data collection to valuable analysis.



### **Why a Jupyter Notebook?**



The choice of a Jupyter Notebook was deliberate to make the process transparent, interactive, and user-friendly.

- **Step-by-Step Transparency:** The notebook breaks the entire pipeline into logical, sequential cells. This allows you to run each step individually and observe how the data is transformed, rather than running a single "black box" script.
- **Interactivity and Verification:** After running a cell, you can easily inspect the dataframes and intermediate outputs. This makes it simple to verify that each step of the cleaning process is working as expected.
- **Integrated Documentation:** Notebooks allow for a rich combination of executable code, explanatory text (like this!), and outputs. This turns the tool into an interactive document where the "how" and "why" are explained right alongside the code.

## Key Features & Benefits



- **âœ¨ User-Friendly GUI:** Simple pop-up windows guide you to select your input file and output folder.
- **ðŸ¤– Automated Data Cleaning:** Automatically removes test data, standardizes values, and creates data quality flags.
- **ðŸ§  Intelligent Data Typing:** Ensures numbers, dates, and categories are correctly formatted to prevent common analysis errors.
- **ðŸ“Š All-in-One HTML Report:** Generates a single, shareable report with data quality metrics and response summaries.

## Getting Started: Your 5-Minute Guide





### **First, You'll Need Jupyter Notebook**



If you're new to Python or data analysis, the easiest way to get started is by installing the **Anaconda Distribution**. It's a free, all-in-one package that includes Python, Jupyter Notebook, and all the essential data science libraries.

1. **Download Anaconda:** Go to the [Anaconda Distribution page](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. **Install Anaconda:** Run the installer, following the on-screen instructions. We recommend sticking with the default settings.
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:** Once installed, open the **Anaconda Navigator** application. From the Navigator's home screen, you'll see an icon for Jupyter Notebook. Click "Launch." A new tab will open in your web browser with the Jupyter file navigator.



### **Now, Let's Run the Pipeline**



1. Prepare Your Environment:

   The required libraries (pandas, numpy, openpyxl) are included with the Anaconda installation, so you're all set!

2. Run the Pipeline:

   From the Jupyter Notebook browser tab, navigate to where you saved the Qualtrics_Processing_Pipeline.ipynb file and click on it to open. Once it's open, select "Run All Cells" from the "Cell" or "Run" menu at the top.

3. Select Your Input File:

   A window will pop up. Navigate to and select the raw Qualtrics Excel file (.xlsx or .xls) you want to process.

4. Choose Your Output Folder:

   A second window will appear. Choose the folder where you want to save your clean files.

5. Review Your Analysis Package!

   That's it! Navigate to your chosen output folder to find your complete set of analysis-ready files.

## The Final Product: What's in the Box? ðŸ“¦



The pipeline produces a complete package of files to support every stage of your analysis.

| File Name                              | What It Is & Why You Need It                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **comprehensive_summary_report.html**  | **Your Primary Report.** This is the first file you should open! It's a user-friendly HTML document with key stats, quality checks, and response patterns. |
| **analysis_ready_data.csv / .xlsx**    | **Your Clean Dataset.** The file to load into your analysis software (R, Python, Tableau, etc.). Contains clean data with corrected types. |
| **comprehensive_codebook.csv / .xlsx** | **Your Data Dictionary.** Your guide to the dataset. It translates cryptic column names like `q5` into the full, human-readable question text. |
| **variable_summaries.xlsx**            | **Your Head Start on Analysis.** An Excel file with pre-calculated descriptive statistics (mean, median, counts) for all your variables. |
